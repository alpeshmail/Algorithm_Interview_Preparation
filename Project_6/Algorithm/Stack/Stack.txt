Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can 
be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the 
width is 1 unit. 
For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6}. 
The largest possible rectangle possible is 12 (see the below figure, the max area rectangle is highlighted in red)

Maximum size rectangle binary sub-matrix with all 1s

Difficulty Level : Hard
Last Updated : 30 Jun, 2022
Given a binary matrix, find the maximum size rectangle binary-sub-matrix with all 1’s. 

Example: 

Input:
0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
Output :
8
Explanation : 
The largest rectangle with only 1's is from 
(1, 0) to (2, 3) which is
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 

8)Rain Water Trapping
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/
Given an array of N non-negative integers arr[] representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Examples:  
Input: arr[]   = {3, 0, 2, 0, 4}
Output: 7
Explanation: Structure is like below.
We can trap “3 units” of water between 3 and 2,
“1 unit” on top of bar 2 and “3 units” between 2 and 4.

9) Minimum Element in Stack with Extra space 0(n)
Note- 9) and 10) are same question but Complexity are different. 
In 9) we take two stack and identify  min element and In 10) we use only stack to get min element.
two stack is increase space Complexity 0(n) to O(1)
