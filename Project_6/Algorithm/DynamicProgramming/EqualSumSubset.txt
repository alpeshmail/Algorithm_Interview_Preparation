Difficulty Level : Medium
Last Updated : 17 Jun, 2022
Partition problem is to determine whether a given set can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is the same. 

Examples: 

arr[] = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: true 
The array can be partitioned as {1, 5, 5} and {11}

arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
Output: false 
The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
