Find k closest numbers in an unsorted array

Given an unsorted array and two numbers x and k, find k closest values to x.
Examples: 
 

Input : arr[] = {10, 2, 14, 4, 7, 6}, x = 5, k = 3 
Output : 4 6 7
Three closest values of x are 4, 6 and 7.

Input : arr[] = {-10, -50, 20, 17, 80}, x = 20, k = 2
Output : 17, 20

Find k numbers with most occurrences in the given array

Difficulty Level : Medium
Last Updated : 13 Jul, 2022
Given an array of n numbers and a positive integer k. The problem is to find k numbers with most occurrences, i.e., 
the top k numbers having the maximum frequency. If two numbers have the same frequency then the larger number should be given preference. 
The numbers should be displayed in decreasing order of their frequencies. It is assumed that the array consists of k numbers with most occurrences.

Examples: 

Input: 
arr[] = {3, 1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1}, 
k = 2
Output: 4 1
Explanation:
Frequency of 4 = 2
Frequency of 1 = 2
These two have the maximum frequency and
4 is larger than 1.

Input : 
arr[] = {7, 10, 11, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 11, 8, 9},
k = 4
Output: 5 11 7 10

6) Sort elements by frequency | Set 1 --- KFrequence.cs
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-elements-by-frequency/	

Print the elements of an array in the decreasing frequency if 2 numbers have same frequency then print the one which came first. 

Input:  arr[] = {2, 5, 2, 8, 5, 6, 8, 8}
Output: arr[] = {8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 5, 6}

Input: arr[] = {2, 5, 2, 6, -1, 9999999, 5, 8, 8, 8}
Output: arr[] = {8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 5, 5, 6, -1, 9999999}

7)  K Closest Points To Origin
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-closest-points-to-the-origin/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-k-closest-points-to-origin-using-priority-queue/

Given a list of points on the 2-D plane and an integer K. The task is to find K closest points to the origin and print them.
Note: The distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.

Examples: 

Input : point = [[3, 3], [5, -1], [-2, 4]], K = 2
Output : [[3, 3], [-2, 4]]
Square of Distance of origin from this point is 
(3, 3) = 18
(5, -1) = 26
(-2, 4) = 20
So the closest two points are [3, 3], [-2, 4].

Distance Formula = x2 + y2
