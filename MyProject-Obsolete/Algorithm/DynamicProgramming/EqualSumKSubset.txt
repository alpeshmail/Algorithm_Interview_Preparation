Given an integer array of N elements, the task is to divide this array into K non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements in every subset is same. All elements of this array should be part of exactly one partition. 
Examples: 
 

Input : arr = [2, 1, 4, 5, 6], K = 3
Output : Yes
we can divide above array into 3 parts with equal
sum as [[2, 4], [1, 5], [6]]

Input  : arr = [2, 1, 5, 5, 6], K = 3
Output : No
It is not possible to divide above array into 3
parts with equal sum
