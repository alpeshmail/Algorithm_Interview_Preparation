Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can be performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.  

Insert
Remove
Replace
All of the above operations are of equal cost. 

Examples: 

c

Input:   str1 = "cat", str2 = "cut"
Output:  1
We can convert str1 into str2 by replacing 'a' with 'u'.

Input:   str1 = "sunday", str2 = "saturday"
Output:  3
Last three and first characters are same.  We basically
need to convert "un" to "atur".  This can be done using
below three operations. 
Replace 'n' with 'r', insert t, insert a


What are the subproblems in this case? 
The idea is to process all characters one by one starting from either from left or right sides of both strings. 
Let us traverse from right corner, there are two possibilities for every pair of character being traversed.  

We can see that many subproblems are solved, again and again, for example, eD(2, 2) is called three times. 
Since same subproblems are called again, this problem has Overlapping Subproblems property. So Edit Distance problem has both properties (see this and this) of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array that stores results of subproblems.
